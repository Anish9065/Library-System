This is a straightforward Mini Library Management System, which is implemented in C++ with file management functionality. Users can:

Create new books which consist of a name, author, and number of copies of the book.
View all available books in the library.
Search for a book by its name.
Delete a book record by its name.

All data is persistent because it is stored in a text file (library.txt).
